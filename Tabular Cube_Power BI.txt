The current session for Power BI or Report Developers to connect to tabular cube [tabular cube creation] and fetch data.
===============================================================================
With this knowledge you can keep 3-6 months experience in the resume.
I want to keep 1 year expereince /2 years...I am giving all the videos of tabular cube and complete material...read, watch and practice.[MSBI-SSAS-TABULAR MODEL]
=================================================================================
Tabular Cubes [Tabular Model [SSDT], Tabular Database [ SSMS]]
It is a a component of MSBI-->SSAS
MSBI: Microsoft Business Intelligence. It has 3 components.
	a) SSIS[SQL Server Integeration Services]
	b) SSAS [ SQL Server Analysis Services]: Two Models [a) Multidiensional Model  b) Tabular Model]
	c) SSRS [ SQL Server Reporting Services]
	d) DQS
	e) MDS
============================================================

What is Tabular Model:

	The model which contain set of tables in denormalized fashion with required aggregate and analytical values.
	As it is avaialble as database .. we can use in ANALYTICS[Excel, Procube..] and Reporting[ Power BI, SSRS, Cognos,
									Tableau etc...]

	This has its own fastest engine[ Vertipaq] which uses in-memory model
	Tabular Model uses DAX language for its operations		

	Uses RLS[Row Level Security] on model
	Support Data Model protocols on tables [Pivoting]
	
	Introduced in the year -2012

How Power BI and Tabular Model are sync?

	Tabular Model is the inspiration to announce Power BI.
	Power BI= Tabular Model + SSRS+ SSIS Transforms+ Cloud facility[app.powerbi.com]


	If we prepare a proper tabular model[ storage, relationships, and calculations(measures or columns)], no need to 
	do at Power BI and directly we can use those objects in Power BI

My Last Project Flow:

	Sourrces[OLTP]---> DWH created-->Tabular Cubes[multiple with sizes 10GB- 40GB]--> Reporting [Power BI]

What is required to prepare a tabular cube?
	a) Tool / Application [SSDT]
	required {easy interface to create tabular model with storage, relationships, security, calculations}
	b) Database Storage [Analysis Service Instance] and Tool [SSMS: Connect and see the database]

TOOLS:

SSDT: SQL Server Data Tools
	a) I will share the link...download [easy to operate]
		or browse and download SSDT

SSMS: Download from the earlier links

Instance Software:
	MSBI / SQL Server Business Intelligence Software [I have already shared....2019/2017..]




EXCEL DATA[BUSINESS DATA]--->SSDT[WE WILL DO ALL HERE]-->DEPLOY-->SSAS TABULAR SERVER[CUBE DATABASES](SSMS)

EXCEL DATA[BUSINESS DATA]--->POWER BI DESKTOP[WE WILL DO ALL HERE]-->PUBLISH-->SERVICE / SERVER FOR MGMT


Tabular Cube Major Operations:

Extract-->Minimal transformation-->Model(Relationships and Calculations)-->Securing-->Deploy to SSAS Server-->Analytics and Reporting Level
